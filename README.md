# Streamlining Hospital Operations through Business Analysis

This project was completed as part of the IBM Business Analyst Professional Certificate on Coursera. It simulates an end-to-end business analysis for improving operational efficiency in a mid-sized hospital.

##Key Responsibilities:
1. Analyzed existing hospital workflows to identify operational bottlenecks and inefficiencies.
2. Conducted stakeholder analysis and requirement elicitation by simulating interviews with department heads, staff, and IT personnel.
3. Created a comprehensive Business Requirements Document (BRD) using Microsoft Word and Confluence for structured documentation and version control.
4. Designed process flow diagrams in Lucidchart to visualize current workflows and proposed digital transformations.
5. Utilized Jira to simulate task tracking, backlog grooming, and user story management for the proposed technology upgrades.
6. Conducted gap analysis and developed a requirement prioritization matrix to align improvements with business value and feasibility.
7. Proposed viable digital solutions such as integrated Electronic Medical Records (EMR) and real-time inter-departmental communication systems.
8. Drafted a change management and risk mitigation plan to support smooth implementation and user adoption.
9. Defined solution evaluation metrics (e.g., targeted 20% reduction in patient wait times) to measure success and ROI.
